         <h1>Tyler Persson - Financial Systems Developer</h1>
         <p>Hi, I'm Tyler Persson. I've worked as a financial systems administrator at Qualtrics for a year and a half now, <br>
            and have been developing within the financial systems I manage for the past year. <br> <br>
            My life isn't all work thoughâ€”I love learning new things. I've been taking programming courses to complement my
            masters degree in Accounting and my CPA/CMA certifications. I also play disc golf and ultimate frisbee, run, bike, climb, etc. <br><br>
            I'm just an eclectic guy who loves to live and learn.
         </p>
